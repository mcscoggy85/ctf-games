1 nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost --open
2 openssl s_client -connect localhost:31... -ign_eof (the nmap scan will give you enough information to find the correct port)
3 Paste the current level password in and you will receive a private key for level 17. I will omit the private key from the repo to not make it public sorry...
