1 This one was tricky. The first thing that level 26 says is the shell is not normal. Ok lets
  check the shell for bandit26
2 from bandit25 "cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26"
3 the shell is actually a shell script getting executed during login
4 check permissions and its unfortunatley run as root, so no changing the file contents
5 cat the file contents
6 the contents is running a command called more to a text file in bandit26 home then immediatley 
  exits when done. The issue here is it buffers so quickly you cant read it. Here you should blow 
  up your terminal size and shrink the window so it can only buffer partial of the file.
7 ok we can see the file but what can we do now
8 man more from local term
9 in man pages you can run a shell command!!
10 try running shell command....no go...its because well that user doesn't have a shell assigned to it
   it has a shell script assigned as the shell so it can not run shell commands from the more display.
11 man more again
12 you can send the contents of the more output to an editor and the default editor is vi, awesome!
13 what can vi do
14 man vi
15 you can temporarily set a new shell env for a user while in vi
16 set shell=/bin/bash
17 now you can run the command sh in vi to drop to a real shell env
18 ls we see another setuid command that can run commands as user bandit27 awesome lets run it
19 bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27......BOOM
20 contents of bandit27 revealed 3ba3118a22e93127a4ed485be72ef5ea
