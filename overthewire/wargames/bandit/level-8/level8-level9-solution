1 cat data.txt | sort | uniq -c -u

*** Note in John's (John Hammond) example on YouTube he uses a third pipe, this is not wrong. 
    Just different.I used the -u with uniq to get the uniq key that rested in the middle of the 
    other keys that occur multiple times. It was just something I tried from reading the man page. 
    Man pages are your friend ***
